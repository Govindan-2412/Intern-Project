Connecting Social media to E-commerce
           
           Aims to recommend products from e-commerce websites to users at social networking sites in “cold-start” situations,
           a problem which has rarely been explored before.
           A major challenge is how to leverage knowledge extracted from social networking sites for cross-site cold-start product recommendation. 
           We propose to use the linked users across social networking sites and 
           e-commerce websites (users who have social networking accounts and have made purchases on e-commerce websites) as a bridge to map users’ social
           networking features to another feature representation for product recommendation
           
Proposed System
          
            In this paper, we study an interesting problem of recommending products from 
            e-commerce websites to users at social networking sites who do not have historical purchase 
            records, i.e., in “cold-start” situations. 
            We called this problem cross-site cold-start product recommendation.
          	In our problem setting here, only the users’ social networking 
            information is available and it is a challenging task to transform the social networking
